Mod for the game Vintage Story

This mod adds:
Oceans:
-there are two variants: the deep ocean and the flat ocean
-flat ocean:
    -in the flat ocean they can spawn kelp, seagrass and corals
    -the kelp grows in a kelpforest and there are three kelptypes: the giankelp, the sugarkelp and the bullekp
   -corals spawn in reefs, there are four types of them: the black coral, the brain one, the large polyp stony coral xD and the bubble coral
   -for all coral variants there are coral ferns
-deep ocean:
  -in the deep ocean you can find nothing else but hydrothermal vents with giant tube worms and deep clams (but trust me, they are very cool :))
-in both ocean variants (and sometimes in lakes too) you can now find sunken ships and ruined sunken villages with different loot
Fishes:
-this mod adds also 7 new fishtypes to the game:
  -the cavernfish, which spawns in specially generated caves below y = 20
  -blobfishes and barreleyes, whith live in the deep ocean variant
  -salmons and pikes (spawn in normal lakes or in the shallow water)
  -butterflyfisches spawn now in kelpforests
  -and white sharks, which will attack you and spawn also in the ocean, in both variants
-you can kill and eat the fishes, BUT DONT DO THAT, they are so cool and exist not to be eaten by you! (the fishes give a very small amount of hunger back, because of this reason, but if you are that cruel, and want to kill them, you can change the "nutritionprops" in the files: blobfisch, geisterfisch, hecht, h√∂hlenfisch, lachs and sharkmeet in the itemtypes folder of the mod)
-you can even cook the fishes (BUT THIS ALSO IS NOT DESIRED)
-craft a fishbucket with a normal bucket, for catching fishes in it
-you can release the chatched fishes whereever you want and they should not despawn
Mushrooms:
-you can find 3 new mushrooms now:
  -the stallionmushroom grows only on meadows, not in the forests
  -morels grow in the forests and on the meadows
    -when eaten, the morel regenerates some life
  -hollowfunguses grow in special caves, filled with mushroomrooted stone (break with shovel)
    -the glow in the dark, need the most time of all 3 mushrooms to grow and give the lessest saturation
    -maybe you need dig through the rock to find some :)
-all mushrooms can be cooked in mushroomsoups
Popy:
-in the original game there is already one popy: the golden popy
-but this popy is different:
  -when broken, it drops seeds and (if mature) popyseeds
  -the popyseeds you can grind into oily popyseeds
  -when you break vanilla-tree-leaves, they now drop leaf-items
  -with the leaves and the oily popyseeds you can craft an oilbundle
  -when you wait some time, the oilbundle turns into hardened popyoil
  -the oil you can use like fat for crafting, but you dont have to kill animals!
-the popyseeds, oily popyseeds and the hardened oil can be eaten
-oily seeds perish faster than normal, but they give more saturation
Uraniumsword:
-uranium is no longer useless in Vintage Story, you can craft uraniumswords!
-they have 6 attack-damage (more than all vanillaswords)
-to craft, smith an uraniumingot on an ironanvil, to obtain an uraniumsword head
-craft the head with a stick to the sword!
Dungeon + Boss:
-in the world now can spawn custom dungeons 
-when you enter them, you will be stopped by a door
-but dont worrie: there is a key!
-next to the doors, or somewhere else in some corridors you will find strange statues
-destroy them, to summon a new monster
-when killed, it will drop a keypart
-you need four of them, to craft the key
-there are three doors in every dungeon
-after using the key, it disapperas
-be careful: the dungeon is full with traps!
-to summon the boss, you will need an eternitycrystal:
  -in the world they will spawn new enemies (souldrinkers) at night
  -when killing them, you can get a temporal heart, let it in your inventoy for a while, and it will dry out
  -then you can grind it to temporal powder
  -craft the crystal with clear quartz and this powder and use it on the altar
  -with this powder you can craft temporal gears too
-once killed, the boss wil drop some...
(no, find it out on your own :)  )
